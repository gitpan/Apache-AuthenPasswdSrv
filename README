Apache::AuthenPasswdSrv Version 0.01 (Alpha Release)

Written by Jeffrey Hulten (jeffh@premier1.net)

This is version 0.01 of a mod_perl Authentication handler that checks
user credentials (username and password) against a UNIX domain socket
server.  There is a sample server included (passswd_srv.pl) that checks
username and password against an NIS database using Net::NIS and ypmatch.

This release is ALPHA.  The documentation is lacking, the code needs to be 
modularized, but the module and server both run rather well.
